  1. GX Works
  
    Issues:
      1. We had to learn ladders (lack of prereq knowledge)
      2. Lack of online tutorials
      3. Lack of physical access to equipment for live testing
     
    Progress:
      1.  We completed the ladder understanding

  2.  Researching Duck Hunt game alternative

     Progress:
       1. Duck Hunt game no longer sold due to Wii Store EOL
       2. We can use Wii play as a backup b/c easy AI implementation but no audience interaction
       
     Alternative Parameters (the game must include these parameters):
       1. Local player features
       2. One player using the Wii U controller
       3. Other player must use normal Wii remote pointing and shooting at the screen
       4. The actual shooting part of the game must be a few clicks away (should not have to replay the story to get to this section)
       5. Must be available to buy hard disk game and not software download (b/c EOL for Wii Store)
       6. Fast AI processing (this is essential to dial back arm latency so that the arm can respond to the screen in time)

     
  End Notes:
  1. We need to finish game research to see if can find an alternative game that fits our parameters

  1. found a game that fits the criteria (local multiplayer shooter game with wii u controller used in tandom
 
    Issues: 
      1. AI will be difficult and long 
      2. never actually played so we cannot guarantee anything (we only watched gamemplay)
